/**
 * TDD for Issue #234
 *
 * Verifies the use-case where-in the function path expression is cached and re-used but the JsonPath includes a function
 * whose arguments are then dependent upon state that changes externally from the internal Cache.getCache state.  The
 * prior implementation had a bug where-in the parameter values were cached -- the present implementation (as of Issue #234)
 * now uses a late binding approach to eval the function parameters.  Cache invalidation isn't an option given the need
 * for nested function calls.
 *
 * Once this bug is fixed, most of the concern then centers around the need to ensure nested functions are processed
 * correctly.
 *
 * @see NestedFunctionTest for examples of where that is performed.
